# ai-assist

Various AI-related tools based on chatgpt have been implemented, and there are currently at least three projects that we want to work on, so we created a monorepo specifically for including these tools.

- Chat: More functionalities are provided than the official client based on chatgpt. It is still in the replication stage, but it is already available. You can access it online at: <https://chat.ai-assist.moe/>(registration is currently closed as the demo site has been abused)

If you want to learn more or deploy it yourself, please visit the documentation site: <https://docs.ai-assist.moe/>. We have also created a Discord group that you can join if you're interested: <https://discord.gg/u3Ag9y3A3D>

> Note: This is also suggested as the name for this tool.
